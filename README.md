## Recipe Parser

The goal of this project is to be able to scrub recipes from the popular cooking websites. Some already built
include foodnetwork.com, cookscountry.com, americastestkitchen.com, and seriouseats.com. From there they can be
exported into a format fit for the end user. Currently the only exporter supported is MacGourmet Deluxe but it
would be trivial to add others like Paprika.

## Why?

Its awesome to have a collection of recipes in your hand. In this case, using macgourmet deluxe on the iphone,
and be able to pull up or search for a recipe quickly and readily. It becomes really important to parse the
ingredients correctly.

## Goals

1. Parse recipes descriptions into a common format. The more unique and re-used the better.
2. Be able to recommend other recipes from ingredients in current recipe.
3. Producde a shopping list that categoriezes food by aisle in the grocery store.
